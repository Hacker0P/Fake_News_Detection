## üì∞ Fake News Detection System

The **Fake News Detection System** uses **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** techniques to identify fake news articles. It analyzes the content of news articles and predicts whether they are real or fake. The system uses traditional machine learning algorithms like **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** to classify news articles with high accuracy.

This project is built using **Streamlit**, a Python framework for building interactive applications, to create an easy-to-use web-based interface.

### Key Features
- **Fake News Classification**: Predicts whether the given news article is fake or real.
- **Prediction Probability**: Displays the probability score for each prediction.
- **Bulk Upload**: Allows users to upload a file containing multiple news articles for batch prediction.
- **Streamlit-based UI**: Provides a simple and clean user interface for interaction.

## üõ†Ô∏è How It Works

1. **Dataset Collection**  
   The project uses the **Kaggle Fake News Dataset**, which contains news articles labeled as either **real** or **fake**. We further expand the dataset by incorporating additional real-world news sources to improve model performance.

2. **Data Preprocessing**  
   The dataset is preprocessed by cleaning the text, which includes removing **stop words**, **punctuation**, and irrelevant characters.  
   Text normalization techniques like **stemming** and **lemmatization** are applied to reduce words to their base forms.

3. **Feature Engineering**  
   The text data is converted into a numerical format using techniques like **TF-IDF Vectorization**. This allows the machine learning model to interpret the textual data effectively.

4. **Model Building**  
   We use **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** classifiers for fake news detection.  
   These models are trained using the **Scikit-Learn** library, and we fine-tune their parameters to optimize accuracy.

5. **Model Evaluation**  
   The models are evaluated using performance metrics such as **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score** to ensure reliable predictions.

6. **Streamlit Application**  
   The interactive web application is built using **Streamlit**, allowing users to upload news articles and view predictions with corresponding probabilities.  
   Users can input a single news article or upload a bulk file, and the system will predict whether each article is fake or real.

## üìä Model Performance  
After training the models, **Logistic Regression** and **Random Forest** performed well in terms of accuracy and recall, effectively identifying fake news articles.

## üöÄ Demo and Deployment  
The project is deployed on [**Streamlit Cloud**](https://fakenewsdetection-sqkrjjwxcjh9gia5i5ar83.streamlit.app/), where users can interact with the system via a web interface.
